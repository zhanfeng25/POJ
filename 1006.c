/*
 * [1006] Biorhythms
 *
 * Description:
 * ------------
 *
 * Some people believe that there are three cycles in a person's life that
 * start the day he or she is born. These three cycles are the physical,
 * emotional, and intellectual cycles, and they have periods of lengths 23,
 * 28, and 33 days, respectively. There is one peak in each period of a cycle.
 * At the peak of a cycle, a person performs at his or her best in the
 * corresponding field (physical, emotional or mental). For example, if it
 * is the mental curve, thought processes will be sharper and concentration
 * will be easier.
 *
 * Since the three cycles have different periods, the peaks of the three
 * cycles generally occur at different times. We would like to determine
 * when a triple peak occurs (the peaks of all three cycles occur in the
 * same day) for any person. For each cycle, you will be given the number
 * of days from the beginning of the current year at which one of its peaks
 * (not necessarily the first) occurs. You will also be given a date expressed
 * as the number of days from the beginning of the current year. You task
 * is to determine the number of days from the given date to the next triple
 * peak. The given date is not counted. For example, if the given date is 10
 * and the next triple peak occurs on day 12, the answer is 2, not 3.
 * If a triple peak occurs on the given date, you should give the number of
 * days to the next occurrence of a triple peak.
 * 
 * Input:
 * ------
 *
 * You will be given a number of cases. The input for each case consists of
 * one line of four integers p, e, i, and d. The values p, e, and i are the
 * number of days from the beginning of the current year at which the
 * physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles peak, respectively. The
 * value d is the given date and may be smaller than any of p, e, or i. All
 * values are non-negative and at most 365, and you may assume that a triple
 * peak will occur within 21252 days of the given date. The end of input is
 * indicated by a line in which p = e = i = d = -1.
 *
 * Output:
 * -------
 *
 * For each test case, print the case number followed by a message indicating
 * the number of days to the next triple peak, in the form: 
 *
 * Case 1: the next triple peak occurs in 1234 days. 
 *
 * Use the plural form ``days'' even if the answer is 1.
 *
 * Sample Input:
 * -------------
 *
 * 0 0 0 0
 * 0 0 0 100
 * 5 20 34 325
 * 4 5 6 7
 * 283 102 23 320
 * 203 301 203 40
 * -1 -1 -1 -1
 *
 * Sample Output:
 * --------------
 *
 * Case 1: the next triple peak occurs in 21252 days.
 * Case 2: the next triple peak occurs in 21152 days.
 * Case 3: the next triple peak occurs in 19575 days.
 * Case 4: the next triple peak occurs in 16994 days.
 * Case 5: the next triple peak occurs in 8910 days.
 * Case 6: the next triple peak occurs in 10789 days.
